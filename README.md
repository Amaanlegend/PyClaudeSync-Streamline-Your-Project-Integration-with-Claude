# PyClaudeSync: Streamline Your Project Integration with Claude

PyClaudeSync is a Python package designed to make uploading your entire project directory to a Claude project effortless. By doing so, Claude can access all your project files, enabling it to provide more insightful analysis and interact with your codebase more effectively.

# Key Features:

- **Project Setup**: Automatically prepare your project for integration with Claude by generating a .ignore file. This file lets you specify which files and directories should be excluded from uploads.

- **Claude Project Creation**: Seamlessly create a new Claude project and upload your complete directory, including all relevant files and folders.

- **Project Updates**: Keep your Claude project up to date by re-uploading your current directory, ensuring it reflects the latest version of your project.

- **Custom Ignore Rules**: Modify the pyclaudesync.ignore file to control which directories, file types, or filenames should be skipped during the upload process.

## Requirements:

- A Claude account.
- Python 3.6 or newer.
- A session key from your Claude account.

Installation:

You can easily install PyClaudeSync using pip:

```bash
pip install pyclaudesync
```

## How to Use PyClaudeSync:

### Initialize Your Project
Begin by initializing the project, which will create necessary configuration files, including the ignore file (pyclaudesync.ignore), and save your session key.

```bash
python -m pyclaudesync.cli init -K "your_session_key"
```

### Create a New Claude Project
After initialization, create a new project in Claude. This will upload your project directory, excluding files specified in the ignore file.

```bash
python -m pyclaudesync.cli create -N "Your Project Name"
```

### Update the Claude Project
As your project evolves, use the update command to re-upload your project to Claude, replacing outdated files with the latest versions.

```bash
python -m pyclaudesync.cli update
```

### Customizing the Ignore File:
The pyclaudesync.ignore file lets you specify which folders, file types, and filenames to exclude during the upload process. 

Hereâ€™s an example:
```plaintext 
ignore_folders=[".venv", ".idea", ".vscode"]
ignore_file_extensions=["pdf", "jpg", "png", "pyc"]
ignore_name_includes=["pyclaudesync"]
```

- ignore_folders: List of directories to exclude from uploads.
- ignore_file_extensions: Specify file types to be ignored.
- ignore_name_includes: Skip files containing specific substrings in their names.

### Updating Your Session Key:
To update your session key, simply open the `pyclaudesync.key` file and replace its content with the new key.
